<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-family: OpenSans, Helvetica, Arial;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">I was undergoing a major spring cleaning in my home.  As I was sifting through my journals, I found some that were seven to eight years old. I was curious to see what I had written. I couldn't help but tear up.

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-family: OpenSans, Helvetica, Arial;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">I saw the same intentions, desires, and new year resolutions weaved across my timeline in so many of my journals: get fit, become profitable as an entrepreneur, get out of debt, travel... I could feel my younger self's earnest desires and struggle. It was lost on me how to go about these goals without giving in to life's distractions and overwhelm. I felt so disempowered, and spent years feeling frustrated.

<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-family: OpenSans, Helvetica, Arial;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">Fast forward three years and I feel more happy, confident, resilient, and focused than ever. I've learned to create healthy boundaries for myself. I've greatly diminished my procrastination where it matters. I no longer feel chronic overwhelm. Even my weight has stabilized!
